<h3>Inspiration</h3>


<p>
During the global lockdown, there’s a growing demand for online media content. This includes online courses, news stories, as well as recreational content such as youtube blogs and streaming services.
</p>

<p>
This demand goes well beyond national borders. It brings a growing need for exchange between the online bubbles that are currently in place. One of the most crucial divisions, globally but especially in Europe, is based on language.
</p>

<p>
We think that having access to the world-leading online courses and the best TV shows should not depend on the language you speak. Our work is meant to facilitate this crucial need. For this, we present the community-driven service for the production of high-quality subtitles: Subtite.
</p>

<p>
We believe that in many ways, the post-corona world can be a newer and better place - not only that of grief and economic uncertainty. If anything, global online integration is the way to go. However, language barriers still serve as the online equivalent of a lockdown. If we can lift it, let’s do it now!

<h3>Challenges</h3>


<p>
In the development of this service, we are going to meet the two crucial challenges. One is to offer the relevant tasks to the viewers, meeting both their motivation level and the sphere of expertise. The other is to combine contributions of different viewers into high-quality content.
</p>

<p>
During the EU vs Virus hackathon, we aim to give a prototype solution to these key problems, focusing on the specific context of educational resources (such as Coursera, edX and many Youtube channels).
