<h3>Inspiration</h3>

<p>
During the global lockdown, thereâ€™s a growing demand for online media content. This includes online courses, news stories, as well as recreational content such as youtube blogs and streaming services. One of the most crucial obstacle to access worldwide, is based on language.
</p>

<p>
We think that having access to the world-leading online courses and the best TV shows should not depend on the language you speak. Subtite facilitates this crucial need.
</p>

<h3>Easiness</h3>

<p>
The service provides you with two-fold way to contribute into tackling down language barier: you can either propose your subtitling of short pieces of video or assess existing subtitles on your native language.
</p>

<p>
The workflow is easy and does not require any special efforts from you: you just watch educational videos as you usually do, and at the end of the video rate 5-second portion of subtitles or make your variant of subtitles for 5-second piece.
