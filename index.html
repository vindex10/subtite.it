<h3>Inspiration</h3>

<p>
During the global lockdown, there’s a growing demand for online media content. This includes online courses, news stories, as well as recreational content such as youtube blogs and streaming services. One of the most crucial obstacle to access worldwide, is based on language.
</p>

<p>
We think that having access to the world-leading online courses and the best TV shows should not depend on the language you speak. Subtite facilitates this crucial need.
</p>

</li>

<li class="existing">

<h3>Easiness</h3>

<p>
The service provides you with a two-fold way to contribute into lifting the language barriers, by proposing your subtitles for the video or assessing the existing subtitles. In both cases, we're talking about a single line of subtitles. Once you completed or assessed that single line, your job is done!
</p>

<p>
The workflow is easy and does not require any special efforts from you: you just watch educational videos as you usually do, and at the end of the video rate 5-second portion of subtitles or make your variant of subtitles for 5-second piece.
</p>
